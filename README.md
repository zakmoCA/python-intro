# Introduction to Python and Algorithms

I learnt about the binary search algorithm theory and set about trying to implement it in python. My goal is to practice python syntax, control flow, and start on learning algorithms.

I first wrote pseudocode for the algorithm and then tried to get it to work in python, which I eventually did.
